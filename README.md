# neo4j-cyhper-demo-01
This is the Neo4j demo that I give to demonstrate some of the unique characteristics of graph databases. *I'm just roughing this in for now. I'll clean it up later (right).*

Rough outline of steps:

 1. **Setup a test Neo4j database.** Outside the scope of this demo, but I find that the free version of Neo4j Desktop works just fine.
 2. Create source nodes in neo4j for person1 (Al).
 3. Create a "golden" record that connects the source nodes for person1.
 4. Create person2 Record (Alisha)
 5. Connect person2 to a fund.
 6. Create a person3 Record (Bob)
 7. **Perform demo. Amaze friends and coworkers.**
