Rough outline of steps:

 - **Setup a test Neo4j database.** Outside the scope of this demo, but I find that the free version of Neo4j Desktop works just fine.
 - Create source nodes in neo4j for person1 (Al).
 - Create a "golden" record that connects the source nodes for person1. It will look like this:

 - Connect person2 to a fund
 - Connect person2's social media to person1. It will look like this:
